## About
QARIBU is a web application that uses AI to analyze existing company SOP's and project data, including meeting notes, company profile, team structures and project goals to form a comprehensive database for the AI to utilize. It then uses this data to create a personalized learning pathway for new hires. The goal is to streamline the onboarding process, ensuring that each recruit is well-acquainted with the company's projects, culture, and expectations, and is ready to contribute effectively from the start.
